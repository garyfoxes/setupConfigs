Download selenium server standalone jar from http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/ for both hubs and nodes

To run hub run this command in the command line after navigating to server directory
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar -role hub
Verify selenium hub is up and running by verifying the url http://localhost:4444/grid/console(or whatever port it is running on)

A hub can also be a node(was doing this for testing purposes)to setup a node you can set 
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar -role webdriver -hub http://192.168.192.16:4444/grid/register/ -port 5555

Can also configure custom configurations like the following 
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar -role webdriver -hub http://192.168.192.16:4444/grid/register/ -port 5555 -browser browserName=firefox,version=39.0,maxinstances=1,platform=MAC  
Can use spaces if you wrap from browserName in ""

CONFIG NODE USING JSON FILE
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar -role node -nodeConfig grid_node.json -port 5555

TO ADD CHROMEDRIVER TO THE NODE(chromedriver is in the same location as the json file config,on Windows do not need the "\" when setting the path and include the .exe)
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar -role node -nodeConfig grid_node.json -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=\chromedriver2 -port 5555

WHEN RUNNING OFF A VIRTUAL MACHINE
Set up a bridged adapter(this allows communication between hub and node) in the network settings(If the adapters tab is greyed out you need to power off the VM and then configure the adapter)
A NAT adapter is already setup, this allows you to connect to the app
When connecting to node to the hub there was strange issues happening. I got it working by:

1.Disabling the bridged adapter
2.Run the query to connect the node to the hub(it should connect)
3.Enable the bridged adapter(this is so the hub can ping the node)
